  With over nine years as a full-stack developer, I blend deep expertise in PHP and Laravel (v5.6→v12) with strong JavaScript skills (Node.js, React.js) to deliver end-to-end, high-performance solutions. As a freelance consultant, I modernized GlobalPro's legacy platform by migrating it to Laravel 11, rolled out comprehensive automated testing, and built a Node.js alert system for financial markets. At Globant (Disney Parks), I designed and developed secure, scalable APIs to OWASP standards and collaborated on intuitive front-end interfaces. I'm eager to join a senior team and drive real impact through clean-architecture solutions.
